# neuron-models-example
Implements several different biological neuron models in python, using  scipy for solvers.  

Originally made as a tool for the class Computational and Mathematical Neuroscience (Math 568) at the University of Michigan, Fall 2019

This code is not particularly well optimized or organized. I may clean it up at some point in the future for use in other projects.

Huge thanks to [Victoria Booth](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~vbooth/) for running such a wonderful course

mostly just the textbooks from the course. I'm missing a few of the exact papers for various neuron models, but those papers are cited somewhere in the books.
